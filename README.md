Fishing-Buddy

Description
An app that's meant to give the user the information he/she needs with minimal interaction, in order to decide when would be the best times to fish. For freshwater applications only (does not take into account the rising/falling tides)

Technical Used
For this project, I used the following technologies:

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Luxon (library for date manipulation/parsing)

Planning and Development Process

Initial wireframes split the app's core functionality into 2 different components, which was easier to code, but defeated the purpose of having information "at-a-single-glance". Hence the decision was made to join the date/time scroll-wheel along with the conditions.

Unsolved problems

As it stands, the website is not optimised for mobile devices with smaller screens.
